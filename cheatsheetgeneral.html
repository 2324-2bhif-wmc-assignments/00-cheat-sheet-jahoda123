    <h3>How are resources (html pages, images, etc.) addressed in the web?</h3>

    <p>
        Web resources, like HTML pages and images, are accessed via Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), which typically include various elements such as the protocol (http:// or https://), the domain or host name (www.url.com), and the path to the specific server resource.
    </p>

    <h3>What is a web server? And what does it do?</h3>

    <p>
        A web server is a computer that stores and delivers websites to users when they request them using their web browsers. It processes requests for web pages and sends the requested content to the user's device.
    </p>

    <h3>How can content be stored on a web server?</h3>

        Content on a web server is stored as files and data in folders on the server's hard drive. These files can include HTML pages, images, videos, and other website resources.
    </p>

    <h3>How is content in webpages described?</h3>

    <p>
        Content in web pages is described using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). HTML uses tags to define the structure and format of text, images, links, and other elements on a webpage.

        The HTML 'head' element is where you put information about your webpage that doesn't appear on the page itself. This includes the title, metadata, and links to stylesheets and scripts.
    </p>

    <h3>What does !DOCTYPE html mean?</h3>

    <p>
        '!DOCTYPE html' is a declaration at the beginning of an HTML document that tells the web browser which version of HTML is being used, and it ensures the page is rendered correctly.
    </p>

    <h3>What are the two top most elements within the html element?</h3>

    <p>
        The two topmost elements within the html element are typically head and body. The head contains metadata, while the body holds the visible content of the webpage.
    </p>

    <h3>How to emphasize a text and how is it displayed in the browser?</h3>

    <p>
        To emphasize text in HTML, you can use the em element. It's displayed in italics in most web browsers, indicating emphasis.
    </p>

    <h3>How to mark up important text and how is it displayed in the browser?</h3>

    <p>
        To mark up important text in HTML, you can use the <strong>strong</strong> element. It's typically displayed as bold text in web browsers, indicating that the content is of strong importance or emphasis.
